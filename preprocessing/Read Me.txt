pre - processing  :

It is the basic step to perform before working on the data. Here, I did applied data pre-processing and 
feature selection techniques to gene expression datasets for cancers/diseases.
A small example of gene expression datasets is the colon cancer dataset, which contains 62 samples
collected from colon-cancer patients; among those samples, 40 are tumor biopsies labeled as “positive” and
22 are normal tissue biopsies labeled as ”negative”. For simplicity, assume that each
such dataset has just two classes. Each tuple (row) in the data consists of the readings for the genes, and
the class (which is the last column). Each gene is an attribute. The columns are separated by ”,”, which
is a commonly used format in data mining. The dataset can be is in p1colon.txt file.

Techniques used are :
1. Equi Density Binning
2. Entropy based Binning
3. Correlation Coefficient.
