Bayes NLP Classifier

Project Description :

   we will compute the optimal label for a second missing word in a row
   based on the possible words that could be in the first blank

   We have the NextWordProbability(), LaterWords() in this file that are discussed in detail.

definition NextWordProbability(sampletext,word):
'''@param sampletext: a sample of text to draw from
   @param word: a word occuring before a corrupted sequence
   @returns distance: how much distance these two variables are apart.
   '''

definition LaterWords(sample,word,distance):
   '''@param sample: a sample of text to draw from
      @param word: a word occuring before a corrupted sequence
      @param distance: how many words later to estimate (i.e. 1 for the next word, 2 for the word after that)
      @returns: a single word which is the most likely possibility
      '''

Output : A single word which is the most likely possibility.
